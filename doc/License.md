* The evaluations for sequence labelling are based on a modified version of https://github.com/chakki-works/seqeval

* The preprocessor of the sequence labelling part is derived from https://github.com/Hironsan/anago/

* [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) transformer original implementation by Google Research, which has been adapted for text classification and sequence labelling in DeLFT.

* [FastPredict](https://github.com/marcsto/rl/blob/master/src/fast_predict2.py) from by Marc Stogaitis, adapted to our BERT usages.
